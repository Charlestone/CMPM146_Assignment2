We have found that if we press somewhere in between Homer's back spine, our pathfinder crashes. 
We have not been able to fix it and we don't know why this happens. We have take a screenshot of the exact point where it crashes and the error that the console displays.

Also, we have not been able to make our custom map. We keep getting errors from the tool.
